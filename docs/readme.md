# Astraea CLI: A Web-Based CLI Powered by Cloudflare Workers and AI

Welcome to Astraea CLI, a project aimed at creating a powerful, web-based command-line interface (CLI) for developers, powered by the capabilities of Cloudflare Workers and AI. Astraea CLI allows you to execute commands, interact with external services like GitHub, and even generate creative outputs using AI, all within a web browser.

## Project Goals

*   **Seamless Developer Experience:** Provide a user-friendly and efficient CLI accessible from any web browser.
*   **Integration with Services:**  Enable interaction with services like GitHub and other APIs for automated tasks.
*   **AI-Powered Capabilities:**  Offer advanced AI features like music generation and other creative tools. 
*   **Security and Reliability:** Implement robust security measures and ensure stable performance.

##  Architecture

Astraea CLI consists of three main components:

1.  **Cloudflare Worker:**  The core of the system. It handles incoming requests, processes commands, and returns responses. 
2.  **Client-Side Application:**  A web-based CLI interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3.  **GitHub Integration:**  A feature for handling GitHub events (e.g., push events) and triggering actions. 

##  Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/The-Astral-Conclave/astraea-cli.git
    cd astraea-cli
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3.  **Set up Secrets:** 
    *   Create a new GitHub secret named `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and store your Cloudflare account ID there.
    *   Create a new GitHub secret named `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and store your Cloudflare API token there.
    *   Create a new GitHub secret named `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` and store your GitHub personal access token with `repo` permissions there.

4.  **Configure `wrangler.toml`:**
    *   Update `wrangler.toml` with your Cloudflare account ID and the route for your Worker. 
        ```toml
        name = "astraea-cli"
        account_id = "YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" 
        route = "your-domain.com/*" 

        # ... other configurations ...
        ```

5.  **Deploy:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npx wrangler deploy
    ```

6.  **Create an R2 Bucket (if needed):**
    ```bash
    npx wrangler r2 bucket create astraea-cli-data 
    ```

7.  **Upload a Fine-Tune Document:**  (If you are using a fine-tuned model)
    ```bash
    npx wrangler r2 object put data/finetune.jsonl -f finetune.jsonl
    ``` 

8.  **Create a Fine-Tuned Model:**  (If you are using a fine-tuned model)
    ```bash
    curl https://your-worker-url.com/files?file=finetune.jsonl
    curl https://your-worker-url.com/models?file_id=file-abc123  (Replace 'file-abc123' with the ID from the previous response)
    ```

9.  **Access the CLI:**  Navigate to the URL you specified in `wrangler.toml`.

**Example Usage:**

*   **Execute a command:**  `ls -l`
*   **Generate music from an image:** `astraea generate-music [image_data]`

**##  API Endpoints:**

*   **`/github` (POST):**  Handles GitHub webhooks. Requires authentication with a GitHub access token.
*   **`/execute` (POST):**  Executes commands sent from the client.

##  Security Considerations

*   **GitHub Access Token:**  Securely store your GitHub access token using environment variables or Cloudflare Secrets.
*   **Input Validation:**  Sanitize user input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Authentication:**  Implement a robust authentication system using Cloudflare Access or OAuth.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of requests from a single user or IP address to prevent abuse. 

##  Contributing

We welcome contributions!  

*   **Report Bugs:**  If you find any issues, please create an issue on the GitHub repository.
*   **Suggest Features:**  Let us know about any features you'd like to see added to the CLI.
*   **Submit Pull Requests:**  Contribute code to improve the project.
